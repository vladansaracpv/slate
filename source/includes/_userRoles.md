As shown within the [registration and onboarding section](#registration-and-onboarding) of the documentation, the platform supports four different types of entities: Partners, Merchants, Vendors and Customers. More details about each user role could be found below. It’s important to properly identify your role based on business needs and current position in the business ecosystem. 
## Partners
